Dwyane Wade averaged 5.0 rebounds per game in the 2008-2009 season, and he played 79 games. To find his total rebounds: \( 5.0 \, \text{rebounds/game} \times 79 \, \text{games} = 395 \) total rebounds.

Now, let's calculate the percentage change in total rebounds between the 2007-2008 (214 rebounds) and 2008-2009 (395 rebounds) seasons.

The percentage change in total rebounds is computed using the formula: 

\[
\text{Percentage Change} = \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}}{\text{Old Value}} \times 100
\]

Using Wade's rebounds:

\[
\text{Percentage Change} = \frac{395 - 214}{214} \times 100 \approx 84.58\%
\]

Therefore, Dwyane Wade's total rebounds increased by approximately 84.58% from the 2007-2008 season to the 2008-2009 season.
